# Windows.FINAL_FBLA_Coding-Programming2020
Submission for 2020 Future Business Leaders of America Coding and Programming State Event

For **Windows** devices **ONLY**. Thank you for understanding. If you have a Mac, please follow the instructions under ***"If the program is not functioning..."***.

*Note: Please make sure your computer login is NOT on an organization network, such as Fulton County Schools. This interfers with how certain files are called during execution. Additionally, please ensure you have a computer admin username and password.*

## Running this program.
#### To ensure the executable JAR file will open:
Download ***"Java Runtime Environment"*** on Oracle's website, found [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). When downloading, it may  ask for the admin username and password. Please enter it at this time.

*Note: This is not shady software. It is the equivalent of a Java update on your computer that allows for Java packages (JAR files) to run on their own outside of a coding environment like Eclipse.*
  
#### How to execute program:
1. Download the above files as a ZIP with the **"Clone or download"** button.
2. Find the file in your File Directory and enter the zip folder by double-clicking.
3. Drag the unzipped copy of the folder to desktop by dragging.
4. Rename the folder in the desktop ***"DesktopCSATest"***.
5. Run the program by double-clicking the JAR file ***"CSA_Project"***.

## If the program is not functioning OR upon opening the application there is no information under "Student ID, Full Name, Grade...":
